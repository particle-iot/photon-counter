* Sockets - [16-pin tin plated sockets](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?vendor=0&keywords=ed3046-5)
* Current Limiting Resistors - 1k ohm 1/4W
* Perfboard - [6" x 6" Vectorboard](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?vendor=0&keywords=v2012-nd)

* Backing - half of a white foam core poster board [like this one](http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/454140/Office-Depot-Brand-Foam-Boards-30/)
* Fasteners - brass round-head fasteners [like these](http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/613827/Office-Depot-Brand-Round-Head-Fasteners/)
* Power Supply - 5V USB wall adapter for the Core. We used a 15V 2A adapter for the 7-segments, but 15V 1A is more than enough.  [This 1.6A one](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/EPSA150160U-P5P-SZ/T1072-P5P-ND/2235264) would be perfect.
